# Telegram Bot with GPT test

A simple Telegram Bot that uses chat GPT's API to read and send messages.

This is just a test so it is very simple, answering to just text and not images.
More functionalities may be added in the future

The current implementation runs in a local environment and can be adapted for server deployment if required.
